# Large-Scale-Healthcare-Data-Processing-Analytics-Python-
This project demonstrates the development of a structured data processing and analytics pipeline using large-scale healthcare datasets related to heart disease prediction.
The primary focus of the project is data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis — reflecting real-world data engineering and analytics workflows.
Rather than focusing only on modelling, this project emphasises preparing reliable, analysis-ready datasets from raw, messy healthcare data.
